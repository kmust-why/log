  Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening  雪夜林畔停留
  
Whose woods these are I think I know.  这林子属谁我想我知道
His house is in the village thought;  他的宅子虽说在那村庄
He will not see me stopping here 他不会看见我在此停留
To watch his woods fill up with snow. 观赏他的树林积雪重重

My little horse muust think it queer 我的小马一定感到奇怪
To stop without a farmhouse near 四周绝无农社为何停留
Between the woods and frozen lake 在树林与冰冻湖泊之间，
The darkest evening of the year.  是一年中最黑暗的夜晚

He gives his harness bells a shake 它摇了摇缰绳上的铃铛，
To ask if there is some mistake.  像是在问我有没有搞错
The only other sound is the sweep 此外再听不到任何声音，
Of easy wind and downy flake. 除了微风与雪片的轻拂

The woods are lovely,dark,and deep. 树林幽暗深邃确实可爱
But I have promises to keep, 但我有约在先必须遵守
And miles to go before I sleep, 我在睡觉之前还得赶路
And miles to go before I sleep. 我在睡觉之前还得赶路
                                                              -R.弗洛斯特
